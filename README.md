# IHC ‚Äì Online Store / Human-Computer Interaction Project

This repository contains the **IHC** project ‚Äî a conceptual online store, developed within the scope of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.  
The main goal is to demonstrate skills in ideation, interface design, prototyping, requirements organization, and critical analysis.

## üîé Overview

The **IHC project** simulates an online store, with a strong focus on **usability**, **user experience (UX)**, **visual interface (UI)**, and **functional structure**.  
It includes phases from initial planning and requirements gathering to prototyping and critical evaluation.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Apply **best practices in HCI**: usability, accessibility, layout, navigation, and user feedback.  
- Structure the development cycle: context definition, requirements gathering, prototypes (low and high fidelity), refinement, and analysis.  
- Demonstrate the ability to prototype a functional interface (even if not implemented as a real product).  
- Document the full process in a logbook / technical report to highlight reasoning and decisions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Create the virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv

```
2. Activate the virtual environment (Every time you open a new terminal you need to do this to make the virtual environment the default Python interpreter of this shell):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
or (Windows):
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

3. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
./run.sh app_sec <PORT>
```

&emsp;&emsp;In Windows use instead:

```bash
.\run.bat app_sec <PORT>
```
5. Access the website:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>
```

6. To generate the database you need to access the following link:

```bash
/generate/all
```
