Summary of each usability heuristic: [here](https://media.nngroup.com/media/articles/attachments/Heuristic_Summary1-compressed.pdf)

# 1 Visibility of System Status
>	The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. 
>	- Does the design clearly communicate its state?
>	- Is feedback presented quickly after user actions?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Lack of real-time stock updates | 3 | Implement live stock status to inform users about availability |
| Slow feedback on form submissions | 3 | Improve response time and use loading indicators |

# 2 Match Between System and The Real World
>	The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 
>	- Will user be familiar with the terminology used in the design? 
>	- Do the design’s controls follow real-world conventions?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Confusing product categorization | 3 | Align categories with user expectations and Harvard-specific themes |
| Lack of department-specific filtering | 3 | Introduce filtering based on university departments |

# 3 User Control and Freedom
>	Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process. 
>	- Does the design allow users to go back a step in the process? 
>	- Are exit links easily discoverable? 
>	- Can users easily cancel an action? 
>	- Is Undo and Redo supported?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| No easy way to cancel orders before checkout | 4 | Implement a clear 'Cancel' option before finalizing the purchase |
| Limited navigation options within product pages | 2 | Add breadcrumbs for better navigation |

# 4 Consistency and Standards
>	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions. 
>	- Does the design follow industry conventions? 
>	- Are visual treatments used consistently throughout the design?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Inconsistent button styles across the site | 2 | Standardize buttons for a unified experience |
| Different naming conventions for similar product categories | 2 | Ensure uniform terminology |
# 5 Error Prevention
>	Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. 
>	- Does the design prevent slips by using helpful constraints? 
>	- Does the design warn users before they perform risky actions?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| No confirmation before large purchases | 4 | Add a final confirmation step before payment |
| Poor handling of incorrect promo codes | 3 | Display clear error messages and suggestions |
# 6 Recognition Rather than Recall
>	Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. 
>	- Does the design keep important information visible, so that users do not have to memorize it? 
>	- Does the design offer help in-context?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Limited visibility of applied discounts | 2 | Clearly show active discounts in cart |
| Lack of product preview when hovering | 3 | Introduce hover-based previews |
# 7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
>	Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
>	- Does the design provide accelerators like keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures? 
>	- Is content and funtionality personalized or customized for individual users?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| No option to save favorite products | 1 | Implement a 'Wishlist' feature |
| Lack of quick-buy options | 2 | Add one-click checkout for frequent users |
# 8 Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
>	Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
>	- Is the visual design and content focused on the essentials? 
>	- Have all distracting, unnescessary elements been removed?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Cluttered homepage with too many banners | 2 | Reduce banner overload and simplify layout |
| Excessive text in product descriptions | 2 | Use bullet points and concise wording |
# 9 Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
>	Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. 
>	- Does the design use traditional error message visuals, like bold, red text? 
>	- Does the design offer a solution that solves the error immediately?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Generic error messages during checkout | 3 | Provide specific error details and recovery steps |
| No suggestions for resolving out-of-stock items | 3 | Offer alternative product suggestions |

# 10 Help and Documentation
>	It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks. 
>	- Is help documentation easy to search? 
>	- Is help provided in context right at the moment when the user requires it?

| **Issue**       | **Severity** | Recommendation |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Hard-to-find customer support contact | 3 | Make contact options more visible |
| Lack of FAQs for common order issues | 3 | Add a comprehensive FAQ section |
