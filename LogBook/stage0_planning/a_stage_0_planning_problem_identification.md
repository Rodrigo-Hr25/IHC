# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem

# Context
This project revolves around an online store dedicated to selling products from DETI (Department of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Informatics) at the University of Aveiro. The focus is on official merchandise and customized items that represent the departmentâ€™s identity, such as clothing and accessories. This is an interesting area to explore because it not only involves typical e-commerce aspects (usability, payments, logistics), but also branding and engagement with the university community. Additionally, it allows for creating an integrated experience with the academic environment, offering a platform that fosters interaction and a sense of belonging among students, faculty, and DETI enthusiasts.

# Challenges

One of the main challenges lies in balancing the complexity of available products (e.g., different sizes, colors, or customized DETI branding options) with a user friendly shopping experience. Ensuring a smooth logistics process especially when handling inventory for varied custom merchandise can also be difficult. Additionally, integrating the platform with existing university systems (for authentication, payments, or promotional events) requires careful coordination and technical know-how. Finally, maintaining consistent branding while allowing for personalization is a nuanced task, as each product must reflect the DETI identity yet still offer room for creative, customizable elements.

# The goal
Create a user-friendly e-commerce solution that simplifies the purchase of official DETI merchandise while reinforcing brand identity and community engagement.
