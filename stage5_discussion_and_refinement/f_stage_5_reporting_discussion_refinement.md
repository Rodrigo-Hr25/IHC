# F. Discussion of Evaluation Results


# Refinement List

After users feedback, we understood that we had several refinements to do such as:

  Do not redirect directly to the cart after adding a product (stay on the same page and show feedback).
	Separate the tasks of adding to the cart and checking out into distinct pages.
	Show order information before finalizing the purchase.
	Add a thank you page after checkout.
	On the checkout page, allow the user to “Confirm” or “Cancel” the purchase.
	In the “Credit Card Number” field, do not allow letters and, if possible, automatically insert spaces for formatting.
  Replace the star icon with a heart icon.
	When clicking the heart on the main page, it should toggle to filled (showing favorite status).
	A filled heart should also appear if the item is already in favorites.
	Add/Remove favorites directly by clicking the heart (without page reload).
	Make filters scrollable to the bottom of the page (internal scrolling within the container).
	In the courses section, display only the acronyms (e.g., “LEI”, “MIEEC”, etc.).
	Show the number of votes per submission.
	Highlight visually or order to show who is in first place.
	Add dates to contests (e.g., start, end).
	Display contest names clearly and legibly (e.g., “Logo DETI 2025”).
	Allow submitting designs directly within the contest page.
