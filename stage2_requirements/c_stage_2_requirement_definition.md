# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Bob wants to buy the LECI team kit

Bob is a tech lover with a strong passion for sports, especially football. When he joined UA, he looked for ways to continue playing while managing his studies. After some research, he discovered the LECI team and TaÃ§a UA. Without hesitation, he joined the team and has been playing ince the beginning of his University journey. 

This year, the team changed its kits, and to compete, every player is required to buy the new one. Because of that, Bob needed to purchase it.

To do so, he visited the DETI merch website, aiming to find the team kit. When he opened the website, he filtered his search by degree, selecting only LECI. However, after seeing a wide variety of LECI related products, he refined his search further, this time using the "Team kit" filter.

Finally, he found the product that he was looking for and he concluded his purchase, selecting the most convenient payment method for him at the moment.

## Scenario 2: Rita has to update the stock

Rita is a dedicated student committee member responsible for managing the stock of merchandise of the LEI course.

One day, Rita receives multiple messages from students asking about the availability of hoodies. She checks the DETI merch website and realizes that the stock is sold out.

To fix this, Rita contacts the supplier to reorder more hoodies based on the current demand.

Thanks to the updated stock system, students now have real-time availability information, preventing unnecessary frustration.

## Scenario 3: Custom Clothing Design Contest

Rita is a creative student with a passion for graphic design. When he found out that the DETI merch store was organizing a contest to create a new custom hoodie design, he didnâ€™t hesitate to participate.

The contest allowed any student to submit their own design, and the best ones would be voted on by the DETI community. Rita worked hard on his proposal and submitted it through the website.

After the submission period ended, voting was opened to all students. Rita was thrilled to see his design among the most popular ones. At the end of the voting process, the winning design was chosen and added to the official DETI merch store.

Now, any student can purchase the hoodie featuring the winning design.

## Scenario 4: Buying the AluviÃ£o Kit for Faina

Bob is a first-year LECI student, looking forward to experience one of the most iconic traditions of his course: Faina. He knows that to fully participate, he needs the official AluviÃ£o Kit, which is exclusively available to LECI students.

Excited, Bob visits the DETI merch website to purchase the kit. However, before being able to add the item to his cart, he is prompted to log in to verify his student status. After logging in with his university credentials, the system confirms that he is enrolled in LECI, granting him access to purchase the kit.

With the verification completed, Bob proceeds with the order, selecting his preferred payment method. Now, he is ready to take part in Faina, fully equipped with the traditional AluviÃ£o Kit, feeling a deeper connection to his courseâ€™s history and traditions.
